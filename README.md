As Per instruction I haven't used any framework, bootstrap or libraries.

i have taken only five elemnets for displaying.

sports.html is for diplaying data in layout of 1:1:2 and 2:1:1 you can open the file in browser.

sports1.html for Level 2 answer you can open the file in browser.

for the bonus question i think CORS error will come and we can fix it by allowing cross origin header.
